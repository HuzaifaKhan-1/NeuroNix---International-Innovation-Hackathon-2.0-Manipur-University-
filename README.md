# 🌲🔥 NeuroNix – AI-Powered Forest Fire Defence Ecosystem

## 🚀 Project Overview
We participated in the **International Innovation Hackathon 2.0 – Manipur University** under the theme **Disaster Management & Relief**.  
Our team, **Team NeuroNix**, selected the problem statement:  

**“Beyond Prediction: An AI-powered Forest Fire Defence Ecosystem – from early detection to evacuation, response, and recovery.”**

This project is designed to **predict, simulate, monitor, and assist evacuation** during forest fire disasters using AI, GIS maps, and real-time data visualization.

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Search any State/Region** → Displays real-time fire risk zones dynamically.  
2. **Run Fire Simulation** → Shows spread of fire hour by hour under different wind conditions.  
3. **Monitor Dashboard** → Provides alerts, live sensor data, and risk analytics.  
4. **Evacuation Route Mapping** → Generates dynamic safe paths for nearby settlements.  
5. **AI Explainability** → Justifies predictions for better trust & adoption.  

---

## 🖼️ Project Workflow
1. **Input Layer** → Satellite Data + Weather Data + IoT Sensors (many more..)
2. **AI Risk Prediction Model** → Classifies regions into Low/Medium/High risk  
3. **Simulation Engine** → Predicts how fire will spread in future hours  
4. **Evacuation Route Module** → Dynamic pathfinding with live fire spread updates  
5. **Dashboard** → Citizens, Rangers, and Officials interact with real-time data  

---

## 🎯 Impact
- Helps **save lives and wildlife** by enabling faster evacuation.  
- Provides **scientifically explainable AI predictions** to decision-makers.  
- Bridges the gap between **early detection and real-time ground action**.  
- A **complete ecosystem** beyond prediction: *from detection → evacuation → response → recovery*.
