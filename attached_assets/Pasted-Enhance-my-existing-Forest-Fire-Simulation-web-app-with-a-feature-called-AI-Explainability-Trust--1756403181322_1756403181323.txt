Enhance my existing Forest Fire Simulation web app with a feature called *AI Explainability & Trust Layer*.  
The system should not be a “black box” — it must clearly explain *why fire spreads this way* (wind speed, dryness, slope), and build trust among officials using the tool.  

### Core Features
1. *Explainability Sidebar (Right Panel)*
   - AI Confidence Gauge (circular meter with %).
   - Plain-language explanation of fire spread, e.g.:  
     “Fire is moving northeast due to 22 km/h winds, dry vegetation, and 15° slope.”
   - Cause Weight Chart (radar or pie chart showing % influence of wind, slope, dryness).

2. *What-If Control Panel (Bottom)*
   - Interactive sliders for Wind Speed, Humidity, and Slope.
   - On adjustment → re-run micro-simulation and show “ghost fire trails” overlayed on the map.
   - Officials can instantly compare alternate outcomes.

3. *Floating Cause Tags on Map*
   - Glowing animated labels (🔥Wind, 🌱Dryness, ⛰Slope) appear on fire edges.
   - Tags pulse or glow stronger if that factor is the main reason for spread at that location.

4. *Replay Mode (Timeline Bar)*
   - Officials can replay the fire spread step-by-step.
   - At each step, show why the fire changed direction (wind shift, slope effect, dryness).

5. *Trust Layer Highlight*
   - A small badge on the dashboard: ✅ “AI Transparent Mode Enabled.”
   - Emphasizes that this system is explainable and trustworthy.

### Backend (Flask API Endpoints)
- /explain → Takes wind, dryness, slope as input, returns:
  - confidence score (70–95%),
  - plain-language explanation,
  - factor weights (Wind %, Dryness %, Slope %).
- /whatif → Takes altered slider values, returns ghost trail coordinates for alternate spread.

### UX & Visual Design
- Futuristic *command-center dashboard UI*.
- Use React + TailwindCSS for modern, clean, responsive design.
- Neon glowing gradients for fire-related elements (orange, red, teal).
- Smooth animations (Framer Motion).
- Map overlay via Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap.

### Branding & Pitch
- Name the feature: *FireSense – See the Flames, Understand the Why.*
- Hackathon hook:  
  “Most tools show where the fire goes. Ours explains *why* it goes there,  
   and lets you test what happens if conditions change.”
